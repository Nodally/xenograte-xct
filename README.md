Xenograte Community Toolkit (XCT)
===

**Xenograte** is a platform that allows you to manage and orchestrate worker processes, and easily design the 
flow of data shared among them, on one server or across multiple servers.

**Xenograte Community Toolkit (XCT)** provides you with a Command-line Interface and other required 
resources to build, test, and debug those worker processes, in [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), on a 
single machine. You can then weave these worker processes together into powerful integrations and automations.
